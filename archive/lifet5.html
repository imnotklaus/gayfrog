		<h1>Gigi Morgan Clark - Threshold 5 Narrative Assignment</h1>
		<h2>What is a threshold?</h2>
		<p>A threshold is a significant point in time where there is (was) a sudden increase in complexity. This can range anywhere from the Big Bang to a microthreshold such as the rise of Eukaryotes.</p>
<!--  the story of first life at the bottom of the ocean, near hydrothermal vents, goldilocks conditions -->
		<h2>Where and how did life first emerge?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>The most prominent theory for the beginning of life is that the first lifeforms were formed deep in the ocean near hydrothermal vents, where the goldilocks conditions were perfect.
		</ul>
		<h2>What are goldilocks conditions?</h2>
		<p>Goldilocks conditions are <em>just-right</em> conditions for complexity to emerge. Just like how in <em>Goldilocks and the Three Bears</em> she finds her just-right porridge, bed, and chair, complexity needs just-right conditions to emerge, as well.</p>
		<h3>What were the goldilocks conditions for life on Earth to emerge?</h3>
		<p>Well, there are three main goldilocks conditions that need(ed) to be met:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some type of liquid: for life to emerge, the atoms need to be able to link up, or exchange information. They can't do this in a solid, where they are too close together, but they also can't do this in a gas, where they are too far apart.
			<li>Energy: not too little, not too much. If there is too little energy, life will not be able to emerge. But if there is too much, it will spread the atoms apart, so they cant make life!
			<li>Chemical-rich elements: without plenty of chemicals and elements, life wouldn't have any building blocks to form on!
		</ul>
		<h2>SyNeRgY!</h2>
		
		<!--rise of the prokaryotes/photosynthesis -->
		<p>After a few years, or maybe a million, some procaryotic organisms developed a unique ability called photosynthesis, which allowed them to turn sun energy (synergy) into food that they could turn into energy.<br>
		Unfortunately, however, this meant that millions of earlier procaryotic organisms died due to the atmosphere being filled with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This was the first mass extinction.</p>
		<h3>And, what are prokaryotes again?</h3>
		<p>Prokaryotes are very simple, microscopic organisms that don't have a nucleus or organelles. They store their DNA in their chromosomes.</p>
		
		<!--rise of the eukaryotes and greater complexity in cells-->
		<h2>Eukaryotes and Greater Complexity in Cells</h2>
		<p>Up next came the eukaryotes, equipped with more <em>advanced</em> and more <em>complex</em> cells.<br>Eukaryotes keep(kept) their DNA in their nucleus, as they now have one! Every living being that can move, breath, talk, ect. is a eukaryote! Humans are eukaryotes! Your teacher is a eukaryote! Your cat is a eukaryote! Even the tapeworms that come out of your cat's butt are eukaryotes!<br>Eukaryotes have something called <em>organelles,</em> kind of like our mordern-day organs! These could perform simple tasks, like photosynthesis or processing oxygen, which allowed them to thrive in the oxygen-rich atmosphere. Many prokaryotes, which didn't have these organelles, died off.</p>
		
		<!--multicellular life and homeostasis-->
		<h2>Livin that multicellular life!</h2>
		<p>One billion years later came the multicellular eukaryotes, which led to the humans and animals you see today! Multicellular organisms were bigger, and could do more complex tasks! Just like how the organelles formed more complex eukaryotes, these eukaryotes came together to form <em>multicellular,</em> even <em>more</em> complex lifeforms. These could contain <em>billions</em> of cells! The cells in these lifeforms all had the same DNA, but each had a different function, much like the organelles. Since all of these cells worked together, the eukaryotes can better adapt to their changing environment. This unique feature, called homeostasis, means that lifeforms will constantly (try to) maintain a balance between the conditions inside and ouside themselves. This is how we have cold-blooded animals! It is amazing that such an important trait to existance has only been around for .2-.7 billion years!</p>
		
	<!--development of brains -->
		<h2>Brains, ammiright?</h2>
		<p>Since multicellular organisms had so many capababilities and so much stuff going on inside them, they needed a way to keep track (and in charge) of everything! This made the invention of nerve cells. In some of the multicelled, eukariotic organisms, these nerve cells grouped together (kind of like how the dark matter clustered together to make the first stars) along the spinal cord and at the top part, which is the head. These were the first ever brains. Brain-Having Eukaryotes, much like Star-Bellied Sneeches, thought they were <em>sooooo</em> much better than Non-Brain-Having Eukaryotes, but in this case they actually were. Brain-Havers (BHs) could send and recieve much more information than NBHs, and could also process and interact with that information better and more complexly, which made things like... *drumrolldrumrolldrumroll* THINKING! Ah, if only I could go back to being an NBH... It also enabled consiousness, or being aware of being alive and being aware of being aware of being alive, and being aware of being aware of being aware of being alive... you get the drift.</p>
		
		
		<!--organisms move on land-->
		
		<h2>Let there be land!</h2>
		<p>Around 475 million years ago, these complex, thinking, aware eukaryotes started to move on land. This was a great idea, really, because there was a lot more opportunities to spread out, evolve, and hunt. The first of these to do this were plants and fungi, which lived closer to the shore and started to move onto the actual shore. Eventually, animals followed suit. However, some organisms did not evolve to live out of the water, which is why we have fish, seaweed, coral, and other marine life. Although land was rich in opportunity, these organisms faced a big challenge, as they had to adapt to not dry out, to breath out of water, and to reproduce out of water. This was slow, beginning with some animals coming out of the water and then going back in, some animals living on land but going into the ocean to reproduce, and, eventually, full-land animals.</p>
		
		<!--rise of the mammals and the mass extinction of the dinosaurs-->
		<h2>No dino, yes homo.<br> (sapien)</h2>
		<p>After the land-fish which dipped in-and out of the water, the amphibians who still had to lay their eggs in the water, and the reptiles who had thicc eggs to lay their eggs on land, mammals came. Mammals are you might see in your house: you, your mom, your dog, your senpai-the works. Mammals most likely evolved from a string of reptiles like out modern-day bird. Mammals could reproduce in a brand-new way: birthing. Instead of laying an egg and waiting for it to hatch, a new thing called a uterus was the egg, and the baby would pop out already intact and breathing. (sometimes)
		<h3>WAIT!</h3>
		<p>There is a claim tester here. Not all mammals give birth. Technically, platypuses (platypi?) are mammals, although they do lay eggs. <br>
			Okay, go. <br>
			Mammals are also furry and warm-blooded, which was something we hadn't seen before. There is an interesting question that I heard, which is whether the appearance of mammals actually counts as a mini-threshold (the thresholds of life) or whether it's just because we ourselves are mammals that we think that way.<br>
		<!-- Darwinian evolution, natural selection, voyage of The Beagle -->
		<h2>Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>All people are the same species, not <em>fifteen</em> different subspecies, with, of course, White people on top.
				<li>Life forms will adapt slightly to whatever environment they are given, such as different birds having different beak shapes depending on what type of food is in the environment around them.
					<li>One example of this is how humans have adapted to the environment they are given, such as how, say, a person living in Australia will have slightly different genes than someone living in South Africa or someone living in Russia.
						<li>Skin tone is also an example of this, humans that evolved closer to the equator will generally have darker skin than those who evolved closer to the poles.
		</ul>
