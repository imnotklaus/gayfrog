    <p style="text-align:center;">American transportation or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the commute</p>
    <p>Cars are more than a United States staple: they are practically a necessity. According to the American Community Survey (commonly referred to as ACS), 91.7% of households own at least one car (United States Census Bureau) and nearly 85% of Americans commute to work using a private vehicle. (Burrows et al.) In the EU, only 50% of citizens used a private vehicle to commute to work as of 2015. (Giménez-Nadal et al. 1) The primary goal of this paper is to conclude in which ways the United States falls behind EU countries in the area of transportation, and whether heavier usage of vehicles cripples the United States. When examining usage of vehicles in the United States and in EU countries, it is clear that the United States is worse off in its negative impact on the environment, disastrous fatality rates, and overall lower mental health associated with longer vehicle commutes.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this paper, I will discuss disastrous effects on the environment caused by high CO2 emissions and low fuel efficiency. I will explore the sickening effect on public health caused by the high usage of cars in the United States, including pedestrian and cyclist safety and the mental health effect of lengthy commutes in private vehicles. Additionally, I will examine the difference in vehicle standards between the United States and countries in the European Union, as well as the negative impact on the environment from the United States’ car usage, including carbon emissions and fuel economy.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the average fuel economy for a 2021 model year car is 31.8 mpg. (Center for Sustainable Systems, University of Michigan) This number is considerably lower than the average fuel economy for a car in Europe; as of 2019, the average fuel economy for a light-duty vehicle was 39.8 mpg. (European Commission) There is no confusion around this: fewer miles per gallon equals more CO2 emissions. (Congressional Budget Office) Despite having only 4% of the world’s population, the United States has 12% of the world’s cars. (Center for Sustainable Systems, University of Michigan) This means that in addition to having far less efficient vehicles, the United States has way more of them, therefore the damage caused by these vehicles is greater.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 2021, the United States emitted 1,046 million metric tons (Mt) of CO2e solely from passenger cars and light-duty trucks (Center for Sustainable Systems, University of Michigan), whereas the entire European Union emitted 547.5 million metric tonnes of CO2 (Destatis). The United States has close to twice the annual CO2 emissions of every country in the European Union in passenger vehicles alone (Center for Sustainable Systems, University of Michigan) (Destatis) while having 115 million fewer citizens (O'Neill). This is just one example of how the United States is vastly behind the European Union in the way it treats the environment in relation to its vehicle usage.</p>
    <p>CO2 emissions can also be charted in the form of pounds of CO2 per passenger mile \traveled. In the United States in 2019, passenger cars averaged 0.47 pounds of CO2 emitted per passenger mile, while rail averaged only 0.14 pounds of CO2 per passenger mile. Traveling via rail contributes less to climate change, emitting over 3 times less CO2 per passenger mile. (Congressional Budget Office)</p>
    <p>The most recognizable disparity worsening the United States lies in its pedestrian and cyclist fatality rates. From 1990 to 2010, pedestrian and cyclist fatalities per capita fell in the United States, UK, Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. In the United States, however, the reduction was considerably lesser than the reduction for the European countries. In the United States, pedestrian fatalities fell by 36% per-capita, whereas in the European countries, there was a 66% to 80% reduction per-capita over the same period. A similar gap is shown in cyclist fatalities, where a 22% reduction per-capita was shown in the United States, versus a 55-68% reduction per-capita in the European countries. (Buehler and Pucher 49-66)</p>
    <p>While the number of cyclist and pedestrian fatalities did decrease in the EU countries and the United States, the EU had a significantly larger reduction in fatalities during the time period (Buehler and Pucher 49-66), contributing to the conclusion that the United States’ usage of vehicles is actively harming its citizens, and will continue to harm its citizens unless better bicycle and transit infrastructure is implemented and greater restrictions are placed on vehicle manufacturers and owners.</p>
    <p>Pedestrians and cyclists aren’t alone in being adversely affected by heavy reliance on vehicles; people who commute to work using a private vehicle are as well. In Spain, commuting via private vehicle has been linked to higher levels of depression and stress, whereas ‘active commuting’ through cycling, walking, or public transportation was associated with feeling happier and more energized. (Garrido-Cumbrera et al.) In New York, walking as a commute method was shown to be associated with a lower risk of obesity, mental disorders, hypertension, and diabetes.</p>
    <p>Indeed, a study in Portland, Oregon found that cycling and walking as commute methods resulted in higher positive mental and physical health, positive well-being, and more confidence. However, these also came with feelings of distress, fear, and lower safety. (Singleton) Feelings like this are shared by many- I myself experience this every time I commute, as I commute using a combination of cycling and public transportation. While I feel energized, confident, and healthy, I also have a constant feeling of unsafety- a car could hit and kill me at any time.</p>
    <p>Further comparing the United States to countries in the European Union, controlling for exposure levels, the United States had 4.7 times more cyclist deaths per 100 million kilometers cycled than the Netherlands, 4.27 times more than Denmark, and 3.6 times more than Germany. This would indicate that the United States is around four times more deadly to cyclists than countries in the European Union. (Pucher and Buehler)</p>
    <p>The solution to this issue seems to lie in bicycle infrastructure; protected bike lanes lead to fewer crashes (Garber et al.), and as proven by New York City, provide valuable and cost-effective quality of life benefits such as reduced risk of injury and a large increase in the number of people opting to ride a bicycle. (Gu et al.)</p>
    <p>Most roads in the United States still have no cycling infrastructure. While some roads in large urban areas and towns surrounding colleges do have some bicycle infrastructure, it is very likely to be poorly implemented, designed dangerously, and useless to use due to there being no larger network of paths. Countries in the European Union such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany have cities with a history of creating infrastructure for decades that allow cyclists to feel safe and comfortable using roads. Examples include dedicated stop lights, raised bike paths, and foot islands to allow cyclists to rest at stop lights. Many large cities have increased the convenience and speed of cyclists commuting to work by installing bicycle “superhighways” which run separate to large roads. (Pucher and Buehler)</p>
    <p>Cyclists are on average 89% safer on roads with bike lanes and without parked cars compared to roads without bike lanes and with parked cars on the street. Apart from actual bicycle infrastructure, education also sets European countries apart; in many cases, European cities also require extensive traffic safety education in schools, which teach young people safe skills for walking and cycling and have stricter rules to be allowed a driving license. (Pucher and Buehler)</p>
    <p>The research done over the course of this paper has led me to the following conclusion:The United States’ usage of vehicles is actively harming its citizens and the planet, and will continue to do so unless better bicycle and transit infrastructure is implemented and greater restrictions are placed on vehicle manufacturers and owners.</p>
