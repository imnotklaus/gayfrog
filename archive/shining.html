<h4>
    <em>The Shining</em> Discussion - CINE025 - 6/22/2023
</h4>

<p>
    <em>The Shining</em> is the definition of a cinematic masterpiece. It's a work of art; I could talk about it for hours and still have essays of content I didn't touch on. My overall reaction was awe. I was trying to not be scared, as my judgment coming in was that this film would be a campy slasher like <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, or <em>Child's Play</em>- but it was genuinely terrifying at times! It's well put together, and it feels like the audience is being gaslit into a false sense of security- which forces us to reconsider everything we hold as truth.

    I appreciated the sound design and cinematography a lot in particular. I loved the scene where Danny is riding his tricycle over the carpet and wood floor. The audio is perfect and a great example of diegetic sound. One shot I enjoyed that showed the director's style was when Wendy is pushing the food cart, and we see her walking through the hall, then she turns the corner and there's a very slow, smooth Steadicam to recenter ourselves. I also enjoyed when we see Danny riding his tricycle through the hallways when he sees the dead girls- we're watching almost from a first-person perspective. It's very visually pleasing.

    As far as acting goes, I was blown away by a movie I didn't have "Spielberg expectations" for. Of course, Jack Nicholson was fantastic in this. His portrayal of a descent into insanity is unmatched by anything I've seen so far, except possibly by <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. </em>However, I want to touch on Shelly Duval. I disagree with Christopher's take on Duval's acting, I think she had one of the best performances in this film, which is interesting because of how she was treated by Stanley Kubrick. I wonder if Kubrick was purposefully being awful to her to increase the realism of her emotions in the film. Duval's breakdown in the kitchen feels very real, and I love how versatile she is with facial expressions and subtle vocal changes. I appreciated how she enhanced the character development of Wendy and was a fantastic contrast with Jack Nicholson as Jack. Jack and Wendy's standoff in the study/desk room is a piece of art.

    While I can appreciate how well Duval was able to act even under conditions nobody should be forced to work under, I can't help but agree that Nicholson delivered a performance for the ages here. His versatility, his body language, subtle twitches, facial expressions, even eye movements- I can't argue with any of that. He's phenomenal. I mentioned that <em>Randall McMurphy</em> of <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</em> may do a better job at showing a man's descent into insanity and the slow realization of that fact. <em>Randall McMurphy</em> is played by Nicholson in that film! This is like comparing red apples to green apples.
</p>

    Lastly, I wanted to give a huge shout-out to Danny Lloyd as Danny. He drove home the film and shone like no other child actor I'd seen. This film is fantastic and the acting is superb, which makes the masterful cinematography and sound design even better. This is my favorite film we've seen in class, which makes me very happy that it's the final one we saw.
