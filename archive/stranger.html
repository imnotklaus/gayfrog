<h4>
    <em>Stranger Than Fiction</em> Discussion - CINE025 - 5/26/2023
</h4>

<p>
    Marc Forster's <em>Stranger Than Fiction </em>shows us the most basic, monotonous and mundane events in Harold Crick <em>(Will Ferrell</em>)'s life for a good ten or fifteen minutes of the film. He does this to show us how dull and lacking in plot Harold's life really is. This is why when the narrator shows up, the gimmick catches us off guard and masks the weak story and unbelievable storyline.
</p>
<p>
    Harold Crick's main goal is to stay alive. He hears this third person, omniscient voice in his head narrating his boring life as well as telling him he's going to die incredibly soon. The main goal of staying alive shows that he's willing to, without a second thought, accept the fact that he's in an implausible storyline and will die unless he somehow figures out more information on this narrative and stops his author from killing him off. He defies our immediate expectations of him as an incredibly dull person with this quirky, 5th-wall-breaking plot device.
</p>
<p>
    When Crick hears this voice for the first time, doesn't believe that he's crazy, and instead seeks Professor Hilbert's advice on being in a story. This is where my disbelief can no longer be suspended- in a narrative that, in actuality, is poorly executed and uninteresting, we're supposed to believe that this 50 year old white tax man hears a voice in his head telling him he's going to die and refuses to seek out therapy, instead believing that an unrestricted omniscient author is dictating his life by writing a story. The narrator forces him to completely change the trajectory of his life and the story, forcing him to move vertically instead of linearly in the narrative storyline.
</p>
<p>
    The major conflict in <em>Stranger Than Fiction</em> is Harold Crick's relationship to <em>Emma Thompson </em>as Karen Eiffel. The morbid, cynical author is ignorant of the fact that by writing books she is creating real people- and therefore killing actual human beings. When Eiffel ends up face-to-face with her creation, she's faced with the choice of knowingly killing a person on behalf what Prof. Hilbert describes as a 'literary masterpiece', or writing a sub-par work of <em>kind-of-fiction</em> and keeping Crick alive. Crick is faced with having his main goal come to a crossroads: he either tries to pursue the conflict with Eiffel in an effort to humanize himself and convince her to keep him alive, or accepting his imminent death as a poetic and artistic one, going out in a noble way.

    As I mentioned before, I'm not a big fan of this whole <em>Death and Taxes</em> idea. As <em>Christopher</em> also mentioned below, without the omniscient narration Crick's life is possibly the most boring narrative one could come up with. I don't want to watch a 50 year old IRS agent go about his mundane life for two hours. The narration makes the film watchable, sure, possibly even interesting; I can't seriously believe that the story of Harold Crick the IRS Agent, even if he saves a kid, is a 'literary masterpiece', however.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, <em>Stranger Than Fiction</em> was a slightly fluffed-up, quirky film that had unique plot devices I've not seen used anywhere else. I definitely enjoyed watching the film, despite it's flaws and unbelievable elements.
