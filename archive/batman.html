<h4>
    <em>The Batman</em> Discussion - CINE025 - 6/18/2023
</h4>
<p>
    The sound techniques used in <em>The Batman</em> really carried a lot of the "cinematic masterpiece" aspect of this film. While I wouldn't consider it a "cinematic masterpiece", it was surprisingly well-received by critics. Unlike many recent action films, <em>The Batman</em> uses only a small selection of music as backing tracks. However, these don't get boring or overdone throughout the film. Nirvana's <em>Something in the Way</em> is played over rain noise and a grainy noise gate, which pairs well with the dark, broody cinematography.

    As I said in class, I think this film takes itself way too seriously for how "goofy" it is. This argument is backed up by the sound design. I felt like the scene in the mayor's bedroom was a setup for a comedy sketch. It was completely silent except for unfiltered vocals, which, for lack of a better analogy, feels like watching a dramatic film at 60fps. It's too smooth, too clean, and it feels like a home video. Dave Simon's delivery in this scene is laughable and came off as a low-budget, poorly-written, flat, sheriff character. When watching a dramatic, emotional<em> Batman</em> film, the last thing a director wants me to do is be on the verge of laughter at the cringe-worthy dynamics and chemistry between characters.</p>
<p>I still think this film is good, but I do not think it's a masterpiece at all. The cinematography is excellent, the sound design is okay <em>sometimes</em>, and I am a fan of <em>The Riddler.</em> However, it's not worthy of being anywhere near as long or as visually dark as it is.

    Stuart Wilson was a delight to listen to on the <em>Team Deakins</em> show. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing his experiences and behind-the-scenes thoughts on <em>The Batman. </em>It certainly humanized the sound design for me, and made me rethink how much it deserved me shitting on it. It decided it did. I wasn't a fan of the vocals at all. Regardless, hearing how the sound team of <em>The Batman</em> was able to hide a microphone in <em>Catwoman</em>'s tight suit was inarguably cool. They didn't listen when they were told it was impossible, and I appreciate that a lot. I also liked hearing about why Robert Pattinson chose to voice Batman the way that he did. I definitely understand wanting to differentiate yourself, and I guess it's not his fault his voice sounds the way it does. Wilson's team did a great job in the jail scene with the limiters on either side of the polycarbonate panels.

    I may have been too mean to this film in my response here. I didn't hate it, I did enjoy watching it. But when films such as <em>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</em> and <em>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</em> are coming out, I can't in good conscience put <em>The Batman </em>on the same level.
