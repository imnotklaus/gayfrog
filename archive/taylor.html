<h4>
    Expectations Writing Prompt - "Taylor Swift is the Death of Music" - Storytelling w/ Jade - 11/14/2023
</h4>

    <p>
        Taylor Swift, global phenomenon, multitalented, beloved by all. The public, including my whole family have expected me to appreciate the music of this epic- yet where others see greatness I see only mediocrity. These incessantly repetitive numbers radiate through nearly every facet of my life. The incestuous beats, primitive melodies, and unvarying vocals force me near insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is wrong with me? A self-made woman, who writes from the heart. Her tracks aren&rsquo;t all about the same stuff, what an anti-feminist I must be. As I embark on my commute, I must prepare my eardrums for the perversely catchy tunes that are bound to follow. With each bass kick I can feel lacerations appear, sound waves bouncing around my skull. Will the suffering end? Music for popularity&rsquo;s sake is simply not music.

    <p>
        The expectation that I must share sentiments with the vox populi is nothing short of demented. Creativity has been slaughtered, buried in an unmarked grave. Grooves of unplayed and mishandled vinyl become one with wrinkles of the collective brain, and consumers redefine music by smoke-and-mirrors detritus boiled down and repackaged into oblivion.
