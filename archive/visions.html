<h4>
    <em>Visions of Light</em> Discussion - CINE025 - 6/06/2023
</h4>
<p>
    I would describe <em>Visions of Light</em> as a factual and expressive documentary. It shows many cinematographers who worked on absolutely influential films, sharing their stories and histories of film. Because of the information shared, and personal accounts, I'd describe it as factual. I'd also describe it as expressive, because you can see how much passion they have for their craft and how expressive or non-expressive they can be through their work.
</p>
<p>
    One cinematographer who stood out to me was Allen Daviau. I thought he was funny and really interesting to hear from, and seems like he has a great story to tell. Another cinematographer who stood out to me was Bill Butler, I loved hearing him talk about <em>Jaws</em> and the camera techniques used for the boat. I hadn't even considered that as an intentional thing to stop the audience from being seasick, but it makes total sense and was really cool to hear about.
</p>
<p>
    I also thoroughly enjoyed hearing from William Fraker, and his work with Polanski on <em>Rosemary's Baby.</em> When he talks about the entire audience leaning their head to see beyond the door, I stopped myself because I was subconsciously doing the same thing. It's an internal battle to enjoy a film with such amazing techniques and art put into it, made by such an awful person.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, I really loved this film. It once again inspired me to get out there and make movies! Hearing from all these masterful people in an incredibly important role that I've paid little to no attention to until this class was eye opening. I loved the broad range of cinematographers they included, and I even wrote down the names of some cinematographers and films I hadn't seen that I was turned on to by this film. I had a great experience.
