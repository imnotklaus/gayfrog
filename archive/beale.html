    <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>
</p>
<p>
    The film <em>If Beale Street Could Talk (2018, Barry Jenkins)</em> is a commentary on the American machine and its incessant dehumanization and oppression of the Black man. It makes the statement that the institution has the power to end or destroy lives, even when a family does everything in their capacity to get justice.
</p>
<p>
    The scene I think drives this home the most is the conversation between Fonny and Daniel. Daniel shares his experience with the justice system, and how they have him &ldquo;by the balls&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s utterly powerless under the &ldquo;White Man&rdquo;, and I feel as though this gives Fonny a more personal understanding of how he&rsquo;s treated in the system. We see how this affects him when he has a standoff with Officer Bell a few scenes later. He looks at Bell with pure disdain and hatred in his eyes, not willing to put up with being constantly stomped on by the White Man.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &ldquo;The White Man has got to be the devil&rdquo;, &ldquo;the worst part is &mdash; they can make you so fuckin&rsquo; scared, Fonny,&rdquo; &ldquo;this country does not like n****rs.&rdquo; These lines in particular show how much of an effect being locked up had on Daniel, and I think they resonated with Fonny on a deeper level than I will ever be able to fully understand or relate to.
</p>
<p>
    There are also stills shown of police abusing Black men in the streets, frequently with white bystanders and many police officers abusing one person. It helps to drive home the thesis of the narrative, showing how Fonny isn&rsquo;t an isolated case; it isn&rsquo;t a fluke.
</p>
<p>
    The narrative structure of <em>If Beale Street Could Talk </em>is chronological, however, it includes frequent flashbacks to Fonny and Tish sometime in the past before Fonny was incarcerated. These flashbacks are usually accompanied by smooth Steadicam footage and dreamy strings backing tracks. The flashbacks are used to show the audience more of Fonny and Tish&rsquo;s relationship, how they are in love, and to give us an opportunity to hear Tish&rsquo;s narration. Tish&rsquo;s narration is another plot device, used to give us information we otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have and increase the clarity of information we do have. In addition, there are black-and-white stills of police brutally assaulting Black men on the streets used to set the mood and theme of a serious environment and a commentary on our climate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The performances delivered by the leading actors were phenomenal. The acting is true to the situations the characters are put in - they were relatable and felt real. The leading roles are very well-rounded characters that evolve as the story progresses. We can see major differences, such as with Tish. We can see through flashbacks how Tish seemingly lost her innocence; she started by being young and in love and ended up desensitized to the torture of the machine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    We can also see how Fonny&rsquo;s character develops throughout the film. He&rsquo;s doing his thing, making sculptures, and developing his relationship with Tish. He starts having a perspective shift when he spends more time with Daniel, losing his patience with the police. We can also see the spirit being drained out of him as his appearance, temperament, and hope start to degrade with each passing visit.
</p>
<p>
    The director, Barry Jenkins, makes some interesting camera choices in this film. For one, the opening shot immediately stuck out to me as I was put into the mindset of &ldquo;something intense is about to happen.&rdquo; Fonny and Tish&rsquo;s symmetry is a poem - their fingers interlaced, they are unified - and we&rsquo;re about to see the arc of how that gets destroyed. One aspect of a shot I found interesting was the lighting in Fonny&rsquo;s bedroom. It&rsquo;s ethereal and shows how this is a significant moment for the two of them. The bokeh twinkles in the background, matching how the light catches their eyes. I also noticed when Tish and Fonny are walking hand in hand to Fonny&rsquo;s bed, Jenkins utilizes a low-angle shot. This conveys power, which is represented well by the scene.
</p>
<p>
    In this same scene, Jenkins utilizes parallel editing to show connection. After having adult fun time, Fonny whispers to Tish - essentially asking for praise and confirmation. We see them on the train, then we see them in bed, then we see them on the train. It&rsquo;s showing how these two simple moments have direct ties, back to &ldquo;the day I found out Fonny was in love with me.&rdquo; Tish sees the same thing in Fonny that she did the day she knew he was in love with her.
</p>
<p>
    The costumes, a major role in the mise en sc&egrave;ne of a film, are no less important here. In the opening scene, we see Fonny wearing a yellow shirt with a blue jacket, and Tish wearing a blue shirt with a yellow jacket. This only adds to the poetry of how well they fit together. Additionally, their outfits and jewelry complement their characters and personalities well. Fonny&rsquo;s family is dressed in an almost pristine, clean way, showing how they&rsquo;re very traditional and stuck-up. Tish&rsquo;s family is dressed using many colors and patterns, showing how they&rsquo;re expressive and not single-minded.
</p>
<p>
    While this is the only Barry Jenkins film I have seen, I have read some analyses of him and watched this film multiple times. I would say that the scene following their positive encounter with the Jewish landlord shows the most obvious stylistic choices to me. Vibrant sunset colors, elegant camera movements, and shallow-ish depth of field with bokeh are all elements that are stylistic choices and seem to apply across the whole film as well as snippets of other Barry Jenkins films. Additionally, Black representation and individualization could be seen as a directing style, as he has directed other films in which he spotlights Black liberation.
</p>
<p>
    My personal reaction to the film was overwhelmingly positive and engaged. I wanted to rewatch the film. I consider it a piece of fine art, because I feel like I could study it for weeks and still learn more every time I view it. I enjoyed watching a film critically, paying attention to fine details, and asking myself &ldquo;Why is the director making this choice?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How does the director want me to feel right now?&rdquo; when paying attention to specific elements. I&rsquo;ve already recommended the film to multiple friends. I thoroughly enjoyed this.
