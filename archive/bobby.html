<h4>
    <em>Searching for Bobby Fischer Discussion</em> - CINE025 - 6/10/2023
</h4>
	<p>
        Conrad Hall uses low-key lighting and shadows in [<em>Searching For Bobby Fischer</em>] to convey suspense,
        and entering the unknown. I felt as though the film was quite dark, and I agree with Christopher
        that the projector may need to be turned up as everything we've seen on the projector has been on
        the dark side, even YouTube videos. The darkest scenes are usually at the meets, even in the
        professor's building where Bobby beats the only other guy there, and quite easily. The brightest
        scenes are usually outside, in the park. This shows how Josh is happiest and most 'himself' when
        he's at the park, around normal people. (Even if they're "homeless addicts.")

        In chess games, Josh leans down and puts his chin on the table, making the chess pieces at eye
        level. This is how he envisions the chess pieces moving around and is able to see at as "an
        artform." The camera also does this, and since we see the world through the lens, we're being put
        at Josh's level by being on this board. The film uses close up shots quite a lot, keeping the
        character's faces in a tighter frame. It's a particular directing style that puts the characters first,
        above the environment. We also see camera work used to convey a separation between Josh and
        his father when he's in the rain. Not only is his father physically away from him, but all the shots
        we see of Josh are facing down, showing how his father isn't thinking of him, and is
        subconsciously placing his needs above Josh's.

        I'm definitely going to rewatch this one. Apart from the entire film, I really enjoyed seeing the
        text "Josh went on to xyz..." at the end. It's incredibly 90s and isn't something we see today.
        Projector aside, the lighting was super cool in this film. I honestly wasn't even paying attention
        to the lighting for most of it, I was so entranced by the film. I'm going to rewatch probably this
        weekend and do a critical analysis.
