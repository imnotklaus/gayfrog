<h4>
    <em>The Graduate</em> and Interview w/ Asst. Editor Pearce Roemer Discussion - CINE025 - 6/19/2023
</h4>
<p>
    Sam O'Steen's <em>The Graduate</em> uses modern, clever editing and cinematographic techniques to help communicate the passage of time, change of emotion, and other story aspects.
</p>
<p>
    For example, in the scene where we see a bunch of clips of Dustin Hoffman doing menial tasks, we see him run and jump onto a pool float, and then transition mid-air into him jumping into bed with Mrs. Robinson. We also see (this is one of my favorite shots) Hoffman keeping a blank, emotionally disconnected expression while rapid-fire editing happens around him. This scene shows how he's detached from everything in his life, and he's unfulfilled by his affair with Mrs. Robinson.
</p>
<p>
    I enjoyed the editing of one shot in particular, and that's in the church scene at the end of the film. The camera uses a slightly low-angle shot with a very narrow lens. Katherine Ross is staring up at Benjamin, and the sound is isolated and almost deafeningly quiet. The camera turns to Elaine's mom, dad, and fiancé before she yells 'BEN!' and the audio comes back to life. This emphasizes her realizing her true desires, and that the people in her life don't want her to have what she wants.

    I didn't get to finish the podcast before I had to turn in the assignment, however, I thought Pearce Roemer was super interesting to listen to. His experience getting into movies and filmmaking was quite relatable to my personal experiences, so that was a bonus as well. I Enjoyed hearing about how he entered the film industry, almost serving as a little how-to guide for people like me.

<p>
    I also enjoyed hearing how he moved up the ladder, and why ladder climbing in the film industry might not be for everyone. What I enjoyed most from what I heard of the interviews was learning about more of the general responsibilities of being First Editor or Assistant Editor that I didn't know about previously, tasks that might not have anything to do with trimming and shaping footage.

    I enjoyed the film and Roemer's interview. It wasn't my first time watching <em>The Graduate</em> but it holds up surprisingly well for a 60-year-old film.
