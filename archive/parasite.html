        <em>Parasite</em> Discussion - CINE025 - 6/02/2023
    </h4>

    The film 'Parasite' uses minimalism to show there is both a physical and mental class disparity between the Park family and the Kim family. The Park family can have rooms that look like they cost an entire salary to decorate, but also are able to have entire rooms decorated with as little as possible because they can. The Park family has more space than they know what to do with. They have so much space that a couple of arrows lying around is considered a huge mess. In stark contrast, the Kim family has a tiny semi-basement filled with all their possessions. They don't have the privilege to just have empty space. The physical disparity is shown by having the Park family's neighborhood physically above the Kim family's neighborhood. They're above the Kim family, and because they live in such a walled garden, they're never going to fully understand how much of a difference there is.

    The class disparity is also shown through the natural lighting in both houses. In the Kim family's home, we see only a couple of windows at the gutter level. They get damp, weak lighting that travels through many buildings, a layer of smog, and the slums to get to them. It shines through their windows, highlighting the cramped and comparatively dirty half-basement. On the other hand, the Park family's home has many huge windows in every room that overlook a beautiful backyard, up on their rich people's hill, letting sunlight hit every dust-free corner of their home. The main course of the sunlight is being enjoyed by the rich, while leftovers are given to the poor living in the slums.

    The sound design in Parasite is used in conjunction with the lighting to express how different the two families' lives are. In the Park's family, it's quiet, serene apart from the people inside, and has natural soothing sounds such as wind rustling the leaves or birds chirping. There may be some classical music playing in the background. The same cannot be said for the Kim family, however. They constantly have loud street noise, some guy trying to take a leak on the sidewalk, and almost a white noise happening in the background. In the Kims' neighborhood, it feels like the voices have to be slightly isolated, sounds of utensils clinking sound similar to the voices. However, with the Park family, the speech is naturally towards the front, showing how the Kims have to do more every step of the way in their lives to get through the day.

    The rich neighborhood has more colors in it, as well as more vibrancy and fullness to the colors. In the poor neighborhood, everything looks as though it's been a poor neighborhood for many decades with the peeling paint on the walls and the musty smell of dampness in the air. In the rich neighborhood, it feels almost as though all the vibrancy of life is being siphoned out of the poor neighborhood and into the rich counterpart. It's alive, it's beautiful, and it's a completely different world to what Ki-woo is used to. I think Lee and Bong designed them to be this way to express a certain emotion, as though we're supposed to feel cramped and joyless in the poor neighborhood, but free and alive in the rich neighborhood, almost to a sickly extent.

    The toilet is an interesting character. It tells us that the Kim family lives so low down that they are literally below the sewers, so it has to be put at the highest point of the room. It also shows us that the Kims are much more similar to Geun-se and Moon-gwang than they want to admit by using parallel editing between Moon-gwang throwing up and the toilet erupting as Ki-jung goes to smoke a cigarette. That cigarette is important in my opinion, as it's very key to Ki-jung's character. She's trying to pretend like this isn't happening, distract herself from her harsh reality. We see that she fits in perfectly in the rich home in a previous scene. As she's trying to brush it all off, the toilet erupts, showing that she can't escape reality.

    My overall response to the film immediately was confusion. I felt as though I had to sit and think about it for a while, which I'm glad I did. I'm quite happy that I didn't know what film I was watching, as this eliminated all prior judgments or expectations I could've had about the film. It was a good experience. In my opinion, the film was enhanced tenfold with the superb mis en scene. The emotions being elicited also enhanced the message the film was trying to deliver, in a very positive way. It played a critical role in the experience that was <em>Parasite</em>, and I feel like I've learned a lot from this film.
